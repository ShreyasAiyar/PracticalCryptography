By default, Excalidraw doesn’t send anything you draw to the server. But sometimes it is useful to be able to send a link to the scene you are working on to someone else. You could save the drawing to a file, send it to the other person, and have them open it. But that’s pretty cumbersome. In this post we’ll show how it’s possible to share just a link without the server having access to the data.
